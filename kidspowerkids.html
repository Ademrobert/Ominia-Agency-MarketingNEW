            <p class="big-margin show-on-scroll" id="big-font">I designed an admin panel for Kids Power Kids (KPK) with
                which they can
                edit all their content. Kids
                Power Kids is a non-profit organization with the goal of teaching computing relating skills to young
                people.</p>

            <div class="show-on-scroll">
                <p class="big-margin">I started with a very simple overview of what exactly is the purpose of the
                    program
                    and what is important
                    so that I have a good understanding of what the user has to do with the program and what the
                    structure
                    of the program looks like.</p>

                <h3>The challenge:</h3>
                <p>There are several chapters in each course, several tasks in each chapter and several steps in each
                    task.
                    In short, there is a huge amount of content to edit. The challenge was to make it so that it is
                    still
                    structured and simple to edit.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="show-on-scroll">
                <h3>The solution:</h3>
                <p>The navigation is structured in such a way that if you are in Course1 you can only see the chapters
                    in
                    that course, if you click on one of those chapters you can only view the tasks on that chapter etc.
                    Below the title of the page is a breadcrumb navigation in which you can easily see in which page
                    this
                    page is located. You can also easily navigate back through this navigation.</p>

            <p class="big-margin">It was very important to KPK that a developer with no design experience could
                implement the system. Figma
                is a very contributing tool, the inspect tab in Figma allows the developer to view the exact CSS
                properties of every component.
                In addition to designing the pages for the developers, I also worked out all the states of
                interactive
                components. The design has also been developed in all available responsive formats.</p>

                teaching
                new skills and
                concepts. The dashboard has been created with great detail, including light and dark mode. Olaf has
                done
                lots of research to be able to develop a guided user interface that is very simple for anyone to
                interact with. Olaf is a great person and has inspired me to get into design myself.”</p>
