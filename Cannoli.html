                <h3>My task</h3>
                <p>I was tasked with creating a social media marketing campaign for Cannoli restaurant, which involved managing their Facebook and Instagram accounts. I developed a comprehensive plan for their social media presence, including designing their menu, wine menu, and street advertisements, as well as creating social media posts using their images. Additionally, I was responsible for creating the text content for their website.

                <h3>The solution</h3>
                <p>To solve the assigned tasks, I began by creating a comprehensive plan for Cannoli's social media presence, as well as their physical advertisements. I suggested various ideas for street advertisements and multiple social media campaigns.
                  
For their main menu and wine menu, I initially created several options and presented them for review. <br> Once they chose the preferred design, I made necessary adjustments according to their vision and preferences, and completed the menu in a timely manner. I will be attaching a few images of the different menu designs.

            <div class="show-on-scroll">
                <h3>The result</h3>
                <p>The end result precisely aligned with the client's vision and preferences. Through effective communication and thorough testing and adjustments, we arrived at the final versions of the menus and street signs. Once I received their images, we were able to craft social media posts that perfectly complemented their brand image and the clients vision. I will be including a few images of the final designs.</p>
