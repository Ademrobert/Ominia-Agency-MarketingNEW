                    the AVG.
                    <br>
                    i. Consent of data subject

                    ii. Execution of the contract
                    <br>
                    iii. Fulfillment of legal obligation

                    iv. Justified interest

                <h3>HOW LONG WILL PERSONAL DATA BE KEPT?</h3>
                <p>We do not keep personal data longer than necessary for the purpose of processing.</p>
                <h3>WHAT RIGHTS DO YOU HAVE?</h3>
                <p>When we process personal data about you, you have a number of rights as a data subject.
                    <br>
                    <br>1. Inspection: You have the right to access your personal data and can generally access the personal
                    data we process about you within one month of your request to us.
                    <br>2. Correction: You can ask us to correct inaccuracies in your personal data.
                    <br>3. Deletion: You may ask us to delete personal data under certain circumstances. In this case, we
                    will take reasonable steps to notify other processors who process personal data on our behalf that
                    you have requested the deletion of links to and copies of your personal data.
                    <br>4. Objection to processing: If you object to certain processing of your personal data, for example
                    emails containing offers.
                    <br>5. Restriction of processing: You may request us to restrict the processing of personal data under
                    certain circumstances, for example if the accuracy of personal data is disputed by you.
                    <br>6. Transferability: You can ask us to obtain from us the personal data you have provided to us and
                    which we store automatically, in a structured, common and machine-readable form, for example, in
                    order to subsequently send it to a third party. This is called 'data portability'.
                    <br>7. Withdrawal of consent: Where you have given consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw
                    your consent, which means that we will no longer process the personal data to which the consent
                    applied.
                    <br>8. Making a complaint: You may lodge a complaint about the processing of your personal data by us
                    with the Personal Data Authority.
                    <br>
                    Exceptions may apply when exercising these rights, which means that you may not be able to exercise
                    certain rights in all circumstances; for example, we may not always delete your data if we are
                    required by law to retain it.
                </p>
                <h3>HOW CAN YOU EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS? QUESTION OR COMPLAINT?</h3>
                <p>To exercise your privacy rights, send us a letter or email with your request and a copy of your
                    passport or ID card. Please make your BSN and passport photo illegible. We will respond within four
                    weeks of receiving your letter.
                    <br>
