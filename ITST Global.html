                <h3>My task</h3>
                <p>ITST Global approached me with an assignment; they would like me to implement a new strategy, for the
                    new strategy there is more demand in the market. After an analysis I came across a number of
                    additional problems that could affect sales and because of this we decided to also solve these
                    problems with the new website.
                    A big problem was that it was easy to get stuck because of the navigation, the copywriting was also
                    a big problem.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="show-on-scroll">
                <h3>The solution</h3>
                <p>I started by drawing up a step-by-step plan that we could complete so that ITST Global had a good
                    overview of when I was where in the process. I fixed the navigation so that users no longer get
                    stuck and improved the copywriting everywhere so that the user can easily find his / her information
                    in the website. I also changed the layout so it’s way easier to scan the website and tightened up
                    the branding.
                    For the new strategy, we added a video so the user sees a face behind ITST Global and logo’s of
                    recent clients for extra reliability. We also ensured that the user can quickly contact ITST so that
                    we do not miss out on potential clients.

            <div class="show-on-scroll">
                <h3>The result</h3>
                <p>The result was very positive, we tested it on several users and the problems were no longer present.
                    The new website allowes the user to find his / her information a lot quicker and the user is not
                    getting stuck anymore, the information is now also displayed in such a way that it shows what ITST
                    Global does a lot better.</p>
